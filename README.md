## Food-price-inflation-and-crime

This data analysis project was my final project for **ECON416 - Economic Analysis with Python** at SUNY Binghamton. The analysis and written comments are all in the Jupyter Notebook file in the repository. All other files host the datasets used. 

In this project, I examine the relationship between food price inflation and the movement of crime in food secure and food insecure states. I focused on food price inflation of different food baskets (Meat/Protein, Fruits & Vegetables, Dairy, etc) and crime data from 2 food secure and 2 food insecure states in order to examine potential relationships and correlations between the 2. Crime data was broken down into violent and property crime rates per 100,000 people.
